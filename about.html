    <p class="text">I was born and raised in a small town in western Canada called Vernon. After finishing high school,
      I moved to
      Vancouver Island to attended the University of Victoria (UVic).</p>

    <p class="text">As an undeclared student in the engineering department, I was exposed to coding in Basic, ANSI C,
      and Java, and I
      immediately took to it. At the end of my first year, I enrolled in the Bachelor of Software Engineering program,
      from which I graduated with distinction in 2014.</p>
    <p class="text">Next up, San Francisco! After UVic, I accepted an offer at Twitter with the Web Platform team.</p>

    <p class="text">I worked at Twitter for 3 years across 4 teams:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="text">Web Platform</li>
      <li class="text">Timelines Client - Web</li>
      <li class="text">Timelines Client - Android</li>
      <li class="text">Notifications Client</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text">
      I learned a lot there and made a ton of life-long friendships, but I knew I wanted to try grad school. So in 2017,
      I
      packed up my things and moved across the country to Pittsburgh, PA, where I enrolled in the Masters of Intelligent
      Information Systems program at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).

    <p class="text">
      After that, it was back to SF for a stint at Stripe, working at a Machine Learning Engineer on the Merchant
      Classification team. With this team, I maintained Spark/Scalding data pipelines and trained an merchant embedding
      model in PyTorch. Using these embeddings, I built a Terms of Service (ToS) violators model and an industry
      classifier.
    </p>
    <p class="text">However, in 2020, I decided to go back to Android development and took my old job at Twitter again.
      What a ride!</p>
    <p class="text">While I was at Twitter, I made the move across the country yet again. This time, it was my partner's
      turn to attend grad school. </p>

    <p class="text">While in Boston, Twitter imploded which brings me to Etsy and NYC!</p>
