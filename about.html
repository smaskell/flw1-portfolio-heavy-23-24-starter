    <p>I was born and raised in a small town in western Canada called Vernon. After finishing high school, I moved to
      Vancouver Island to attended the University of Victoria (UVic).</p>

    <p>As an undeclared student in the engineering department, I was exposed to coding in Basic, ANSI C, and Java, and I
      immediately took to it. At the end of my first year, I enrolled in the Bachelor of Software Engineering program,
      from which I graduated with distinction in 2014.</p>
    <p>Next up, San Francisco! After UVic, I accepted an offer at Twitter with the Web Platform team.</p>

        <li>Timelines Client - Android</li>
